## This project is a tutorial project for REACT and PHP

The goal of this project is to prompt the user to submit a form asking for City and State.
When the user submits the City and State, the website will connect to Google Maps API
and present the user with a map of the city. Next, the user will be able to search for local
restaurants in the city/state using Yelp's API. Once the user types a category of
restaurant, the top local 10 restaurants will be presented to the user, with the location pinged
on the Google Map. Objectives listed below:

- [x] The user is prompted with the form.

- [x] The user is prompted to enter a category of food.
- [ ] 10 local, top restaurants are pinged on the map.
- [ ] The user can click on a ping and restaurant information is presented.
